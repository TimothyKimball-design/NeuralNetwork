# NeuralTone

**Overview**

A set of target images is used to train the neural network, and the trained model is then applied to improve an input image. To increase overall performance, multiple neural networks were added and are trained simultaneously during the training process.

Training Data: A set of target images is used to prepare the training data.

Neural Network: Neural networks are constructed and trained in parallel.

Enhancement: Using the trained neural networks, the input image is made better.

Output Image: Enhanced.jpg is where the improved image is saved.

**Configuration**

You can tweak the neural network architecture, training parameters, and other settings in the NeuralNetworkForPictureEnchancement.java file.

**Neural Network Architecture**

The neural network architecture consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The number of nodes in the hidden layer is configurable.
